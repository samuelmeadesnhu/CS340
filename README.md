How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Thorough planning is a key component to writing maintainable, readable, and reusable code. The balance of Agile is not over-planning to remain malleable, but planning enough to code with foresight, writing itterative pieces intended for reuse. For example, our CRUD API not only acts as a maintainable proxy between the client and server, but also improves readability with modular code. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Considering the ask, the value, and the architecture is how I approach most problems. The database dashboard was intended to have users easily manage data from a secure interface. To address this need, we developed user accounts within the database with different access levels, an API to interface with the data, and a python front end for user experience. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve problems and build communicative infrastructure to connect people via technology. Their work can be applied accross numerous applications with varying value. This work can automate repetitive processes, provide functionality, or even add security. Computer scientists are imperitive to the modern technological world.
